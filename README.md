Chat GPT stands for Chat Generative  Pre-Trained Transformer and was developed by an AI research company, Open AI. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot technology that can process our natural human language and generate a response. Simply put – you can ask Chat GPT a question, and it will give you an answer.

For example, we asked Chat GPT, “What is assistive technology?”:

Assistive technology refers to any device, equipment, or software that is designed to assist people with disabilities in performing tasks that might otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform.

However, it is so much more than that. You can ask it to explain quantum mechanics, help you plan a fun day in New York City as a tourist, write computer code or solve mathematical equations.

The latest version of GPT, GPT 4, can process images or create a design.
